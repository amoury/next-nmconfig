## Next.js with node-nmConfig and Reconfig

This is a demo app to show the setup of the config files. We can add the whole app config to the `base.yml` file and it uses the npm package [`node-nmconfig`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-nmconfig).

The whole setup can be done from `next.config.js`. 

## Start the App

To start the app for development -
1. run `npm install` or `yarn`
2. type `yarn dev` to spin up the local server. 

Visit the route `/test` and view the logs in the dev inspector.
